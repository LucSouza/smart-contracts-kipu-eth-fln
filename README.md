#Repository for smart contracts created during the Solidity course.

Hi everybody, this is Lucas. I'm a software developer who started in 2021. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems in 2021 and have been working at the same company ever since as a full-stack developer with Java and JavaScript (Vue.js framework).

I've known about blockchains since 2017 when I used to complete faucets and other tasks to earn crypto. Unfortunately, I spent all I had earned before it reached its real market value. I have been interested in smart contracts for a long time but never had the chance to take a course to learn how to develop them. I'm taking this course to improve my technical skills and grow as a developer.
